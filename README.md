## UI/UX

The design of the site is pretty simplistic yet modern I would say, with the easy-to-see navbar presenting the products the site is offering. The site follows a mostly black-and-white theme, where the fancy shade of red was used for some detailing.

The main background shows the first-time visitor what the site is about, and that the site is for those who cook with passion and expect nothing but quality.

### Agile Development

The site is developed according to the Agile Methodology, where the GitHub Project feature was used to utilize the Kanban board for this purpose.

While developing, I chose one issue to work on from the "Todo" column of the Kanban board and moved it into the "In Progress" column.

After I was done with the issue by fulfilling all the acceptance criteria, I moved the issue into the "Done" Column.

#### MoSCoW Prioratization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method to label my issues(user stories/features):
  - Must Have
  - Should Have
  - Could Have
  - Won't Have

The Must Have having the highest priority, next being Should Have and then Could Have, Won't Have presenting the features not being implemented at this point and time.
